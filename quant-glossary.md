## A

### Alpha
> Measure of the performance of an investment strategy in excess of the expected return for its level of risk (generally measured by beta).

### Arbitrage
> Strategy that seeks to profit without risk by taking advantage of price differences between markets.

### Appreciation
> A positive growth.

### Average Annual Return
> The annual return on an investment.
> The correct way of calculating the average annual return is to use a [geometric average return](#geometric-average-return):

$$
\begin{equation}
i = \sqrt[N]{\frac{FV}{PV}} - 1
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
i = \sqrt[N]{\sum_{j=1}^{N} 1 + i_j} - 1
\end{equation}
$$

> Also known as: **Average annual interest rate**, **Compound average annual return** and **True return**.

> [See also: Return](#return)

### Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
> Nominal annual rate for a compound interest. ???
> It handles situations in which there is compounding more frequently than once a year.

> **Note**: The investment's value increases at a faster rate with the increased frequency of compounding.

> [See also: Compound Interest](#compound-interest)

### Annuities
> A **series of cash flows** of **equal amount**, occurring at **even intervals**. 
> Evaluate a series of level cash flows - each cash flow is the same amount as the others - received at regular intervals.
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
FV &= \sum_{t = 1}^{N} {CF (1 + i)^{N - t}} \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} (1 + i)^{N - t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
$$
\begin{equation}
FV = CF \frac{(1 + i)^N - 1}{i}
\end{equation}
$$
> $t$: time period corresponding to a particular cash flow.

> This equation tells us that the **future value** of a **level series of cash flows**, occurring at **regular intervals** **beginning one period from today**, is equal to the amount **of cash flows multiplied** by the **sum of the compound factors**.

> The equation for the present value of a series of level cash flows beginning after one period simplifies to:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
PV &= \sum_{t = 1}^{N} {CF \left( \frac{1}{(1 + i)} \right)^t} \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} \left( \frac{1}{(1 + i)} \right)^t \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{(1 + i)^t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
PV &= CF \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + i)^N}}{i} \\
&= CF \frac{(1 + i)^N - 1}{i (1 + i)^N}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
> This equations tells us that the **present value** of an **annuity** is equal to the **amount of one cash flow multiplied** by the **sum of the discount factors**.

> These equations are examples of [ordinary annuities](#ordinary-annuity).

> [See also: Future value annuity factor](#future-value-annuity-factor).
> [See also: Present value annuity factor](#present-value-annuity-factor).

## I

### Investment Decisions
> Concerned with the use of funds: 
- Buying
- Holding
- Selling

### Investment Management
> Specialty area within finance dealing with the management of individual or institutional funds.

> Also known as: *Asset management*, *Portfolio management*, *Money management* and *Wealth management*.

> Involves five activities:
1. Setting investment objectives: thorough analysis of what the entity wants to accomplish.
2. Establishing an investment policy: policy guidelines must be established, taking into consideration any client-imposed investment constraints, legal/regulatory constraints, and tax restrictions. This task begins with the **asset allocation decision** (i.e., how the funds are to be allocated among the major asset classes).
3. Selecting an investment strategy: a portfolio strategy that is consistent with the investment objectives and investment policy guidelines must be selected.
4. Selecting the specific assets: selecting the specific financial assets to include in the portfolio, which is referred to as the **portfolio selecting problem**.
5. Measuring and evaluating investment performance

### Interest
> Compensation for the **use of funds** for a specific period.

> It consists of:
- Compensation for the length of time the money is borrowed
- Compensation for the risk that the amount borrowed will not be repaid exactly as set forth in the **loan agreement**.

### Interest on Interest
> Interest on accumulated interest.

### Loan Amortization
> (Analysis of the repayment of a loan).
> **Repayment of a loan** with **equal payments** over a **specified period of time**.

## M

### Multiple Rates
> Calculation of a future value considering different interest rates or growth rates for different periods.

## O

### Ordinary Annuity
> Special form of [annuity](#annuities), where the first cash flow occurs at the end of the first period.

> Future value of an ordinary annuity:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
FV &= \sum_{t = 1}^{N} {CF (1 + i)^{N - t}} \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} (1 + i)^{N - t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

> Present value of an ordinary annuity:

PV &= \sum_{t = 1}^{N} {CF \left( \frac{1}{(1 + i)} \right)^t} \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} \left( \frac{1}{(1 + i)} \right)^t \\
&= CF \sum_{t = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{(1 + i)^t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
> $t$: time period corresponding to a particular cash flow.

## P

### Principal
> 

### Theory of Portfolio Selection
> Formualted by Harry Markowitz in 1952.
> This theory proposes how investors can construct portfolios based on two parameters:
- **Mean return**
- **Standard deviation of returns** *(meassure of risk)*

### Present Value
> 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
PV &= \frac{FV}{(1 + i)^N} \\
&= FV \left( \frac{1}{1 + i} \right)^N \\
&= FV \left[ \frac{1}{(1 + i)^N} \right]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

> If the frequency of compounding is greater than once a year, we make adjustements to the **rate per period ($i$)** and the **number of periods ($N$)**.

### Present Value Annuity Factor
> Sum of the **discounting factors** for a given interest rate $i$, and number of periods $N$.
$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{t = 1}^{N} \frac{1}{(1 + i)^{t}}
\end{equation}
$$

> Another more convenient way of solving for the PV of an annuity is to rewrite the factor as:
$$
\begin{equation}
\text{Present value annuity factor} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + i)^N}}{i}
\end{equation}
$$

### Return
> The income on an investment, generally stated as a change in the value of the investment over each period divided by the amount at the investment at the beginning of the period.

### Risk Management
> Involves determining which risks to **accept**, which to **neutralize**, and which to **transfer**.

> Four key processes in risk manegement:
1. Risk identification
2. Risk assessment
3. Risk mitigation
4. Risk transferring

## T

&= \sum_{t = 0}^{N}{CF_t \left( \frac{1}{1 + t} \right)^t}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
> The present value of a series of cash flows is the sum of the products of each cash flow and its corresponding discount factor.

> In many real-world applications multiple interest rates are used. 
> The interest rate that can be earned depends on the amount of time the investment is expected to be **outstanding**.
> Typically, there is a **positive relationship** between **interest rates** and the **length of time the investment must be held**.
> The formula for the PV of a series of cash flows when there is a different interest rate:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
PV &= CF_0 \left( \frac{1}{1 + i_0} \right)^0 + ... + CF_N \left( \frac{1}{1 + i_N} \right)^N \\
&= \sum_{t = 0}^{N}{CF_t \left( \frac{1}{1 + i_t} \right)^t}
\end{aligned}

## V

### Valuation
> Process of determing the fair value of a financial asset.

> It's fundamental principle is that the value of any financial asset is the present value of the expected cash flows.

> The valuation of a financial asset involves:

3. Calculating the present value of the expected cash flows using the interest rate or interests rates
