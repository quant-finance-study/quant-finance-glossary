### Descriptions
- **Current price**: The last traded price of one share of the company's stock on the stock exchange.
It reflects what the market currently values the stock at.
*Note*: This number changes constantly during market hours.
- **Performance**: The percentage change in the stock price over the past 1 year and 5 years.
Shows how much the stock has gained or lost in value over time.
*Note*: Longer time frames help identify trends beyond short-term noise.
- **P/E ratio (Price/Earnings)**: The ratio of the stock's current price to its earnings per share (EPS).

$$
\begin{equation}
P/E = \frac{\text{Price per share}}{\text{Earnings per share} (EPS)}
\end{equation}
$$

It tells how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings.
    - High P/E: Market expects strong growth (but maybe overvalued).
    - Low P/E: Possibly undervalued or lower growth prospects.
*Example*: P/E of 30 means investors pay $30 for every $1 the company earns.
- **Dividend yield (%)**: The annual dividends paid by the company divided by its stock price, expressed as a percentage.

$$
\begin{equation}
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual dividends per share}}{{Price per share}} \times 100
\end{equation}
$$

Shows how much cash flow (income) you earn from dividends relative to the price you paid.
*Example*: Dividend yield of 2% means you earn $2/year for every $100 invested.
*Note*: Some companies (like Tesla) don't pay dividends.
- **Beta**: A measure of the stock's volatility relative to the overall market (usually S&P 500).
*Benchmark*: Market beta = 1.
    - Beta > 1: Stock is **more volatile** than the market.
    - Beta < 1: Stock is **less volatile** than the market.
- **Approximate volatility (daily or annualized, if available)**: A measure of how much and how fast the stock price fluctuates.
Usually expressed as a standard deviation of returns, either daily or annualized.
    - Higher volatility = greater price swings (riskier).
*Example* Daily volatility of 2% means the stock price moves about +/- 2% on a typical day.
